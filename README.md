# CSE-518-Security-Project

For our project we chose to do VulWitch based on our interest in AI applications and how we can apply security to these.  
Our group consists of multiple masters' students in the following disciplines:  
Eldar Hamzic | eldarham@buffalo.edu | MS Computer Science & Engineering  
Chase Allard | chaseall@buffalo.edu | MS Computer Science & Engineering  
Hongbin Jin  | hongbinj@buffalo.edu | MS Computer Science & Engineering  
Jeffrey Yau  | jyau6@buffalo.edu    | MS Computer Science & Engineering

## Play around with AST

You can use [ast\_dump.py](/ast_main.py) to play around with abstract syntax
trees (ASTs).

```shell
$ python3 -m venv --prompt ast .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
(ast) $ pip install ./
(ast) $ python3 ast_dump.py --lang python ast_dump.py
```
